    "art_style_description": "STYLE:\nHeavy black outlines around the entire character. Thick contour lines that define the silhouette. Thinner interior linework for muscles, armor, and details.\n\nSHADING:\nSmooth airbrushed shading with a glossy, high-impact finish. Clean gradients that emphasize volume. No grain, no noise, no painterly texture. Large highlight shapes and sharp shadow bands.\n\nCOLOR:\nSlightly saturated but realistic color palette. Liberal use of black. Midtones with clean shadows. Neutral white light that does not tint surfaces.\n\nRENDERING:\nClean vector-like clarity. Polished, arcade-cabinet quality. Surfaces appear smooth, glossy, and dimensional. Clear silhouette readability from a distance.\n\nVIBE:\nDramatic, powerful, larger-than-life presence. Character feels iconic and designed for a boss-select portrait or cabinet marquee art. Every element is bold, stylized, and immediately eye-catching.\n\nNEGATIVE PROMPTS:\nNo realism, no film lighting, no grain, no painterly strokes, no noise, no soft pastel look, no watercolor effects, no 3D rendering, no photographic shading, no atmospheric colored lighting. No rim lighting. No muted or desaturated colors, no neon colors, no toy-like hues.",

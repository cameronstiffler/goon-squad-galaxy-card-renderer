    "art_style_description": "Create an illustration of a character using 90s arcade as the base art style. The following guidelines should be followed and take precedence over any defined base art style: Lighting should beneutral. Must have glossy surfaces with bold shadows and highlights that emphasize character volume. Use a limited but varied color palette of medium-saturated earth tones. The character design should feel powerful, and sophisticated. Image must be 593x518 pixels in size."
